--> You picked great images. Consider giving them better defined subtitles. Or making the padding around them thicker.

My site is at heart a news site, whose target audience are Chelsea fans. Most of these (hopefully loyal) fans know every single player on the team by heart, and don't need subtitles on pictures to help them out. Furthermore, I think adding subtitles to the pictures will take away from the minimalist design philosophy I hope to achieve with this product, and add a lot of noisy text. I also believe any confusion about who is in the picture can be extrapolated and contextually resolved by reading the article.  However, I added borders and padding to accentuate the pictures.

--> Putting the scores at the top would provide a quick update on the state of Chelsea's latest matches and make the site even more scanable.
This is a good suggestion. Most users in the internet age have very little patience, and although I do my best to make the site succinct, many users looking for a quick score update will simply click away rather than scrolling down to the stat section. I incorporated both the most recent scores, and the next upcoming games to provide the arguably optimal blend of present and future game information.

--> Increasing the border width of the league table- or styling it slightly different than the rest of the web page would make it stand out more as an added feature to the site and make it more interesting to engage with. Also consider changing the text's font a bit.

I don't think the table should necessarily stand out since it is just another statistic, and the amount of screen real estate it occupies is already calls attention to its importance. However I made the borders bigger, and was happy with the end result. I changed the text from a serif to a san serif style in the stats section. In general, I stuck with serif for article text and headlines since it lends a Victorian sophisticated look to the site a la the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal. The numbers have been changed to sans serif to make them more readable and aesthetically appealing as this reviewer has generously pointed out.

Maybe changing the color of the dark blue sections to something lighter/more transparent. the "More stories" button could also be made to expand the section?

Overall it looks very good and clean; very easy to navigate and read.
Might make sense to put the latest scores at the top, make the section smaller too.
Otherwise, not much to complain about.

Try putting latest scores and the league table together in the same section of the page. Each looks like it takes up a bit too much space.
The ByLine at the beginning of the page could be bigger. Have it fill the page.
Incorporate your own custom content. You do really well with outside content. Write a short "about the author" piece with why you created the site and why you love futbol and you should be golden.
